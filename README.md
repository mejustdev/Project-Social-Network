### Initial Configuration

1. Database

We are using [MongoDb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_emea_netherlands_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624536&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhP2BBhDdARIsAJEzXlENhhMw2W76Dl-ZoL-toHgfrm7LIQfTOLETUeR6eBdO1KMLwp3d0pQaAuXwEALw_wcB) but you can also choose local database integration. You need `MongoDb Connection String` to connect your cluster.

2. Github Token

This is for listing user's repos. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to access it.

3. Deployment

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account

- Make sure you have installed `Node.js` and `npm`.

### Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mejustdev/Project-Social-Network.git
cd Project-Social-Network

# Install server dependencies

npm install

# Install client dependencies

cd client
npm install
```

Create `default.json` file in config folder and paste your credentials.

> :collision: Do not forget to add this file to the `.gitignore`.

```shell
#  config/default.json

{
  "mongoURI": "",
  "jwtSecret": "",
  "githubToken": ""
}
```

#### Running on Development Mode

```
# Run both Express & React from

npm run dev
```

#### Building

```
cd client
npm run build
```

### Deploying / Publishing

Create your repository on Github. Then use Git Flow and finally push it to the remote.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "initializing project"
git push origin main
```

#### Test production before deploy

After running a build in the client ðŸ‘†, cd into the root of the project.  
And run...

Linux/Unix

```bash
NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```

Windows Cmd Prompt or Powershell

```bash
$env:NODE_ENV="production"
node server.js
```

Check in browser on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

#### Deploy to Heroku

```bash
git checkout -b production
```

We can use this branch to deploy from, with our config files.

Add the config file...

```bash
git add -f config/production.json
```

This will track the file in git on this branch only. **DON'T PUSH THE PRODUCTION BRANCH TO GITHUB**

Commit...

```bash
git commit -m 'ready to deploy'
```

Create your Heroku project

```bash
heroku create
```

And push the local production branch to the remote heroku main branch.

```bash
git push heroku production:main
```

Now Heroku will have the config it needs to build the project.

> **Don't forget to make sure your production database is not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas, otherwise the database connection will fail and your app will crash.**

After deployment you can delete the production branch if you like.

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D production
```

Or you can leave it to merge and push updates from another branch.  
Make any changes you need on your main branch and merge those into your production branch.

```bash
git checkout production
git merge main
```

Once merged you can push to heroku as above and your site will rebuild and be updated.
